# Projecting scRNA-seq data onto a reference map of TIL states

This demo will walk you through a complete dataset projection and analysis using ProjecTILs. We will use as a query set the Tetramer+ CD8+ T cells from the study by [Miller et al., Nature Immunol (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778252/)


### How to play the demo on your machine

Copy this repository to your local system:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.unil.ch/carmona/ProjecTILs.demo.git
```

Then move to the `ProjecTILs.demo` folder and open `ProjecTILs.demo.Rproj` in RStudio. In this enviroment, you can follow step-by-step the commands outlined in `ProjecTILs.demo.Rmd`
